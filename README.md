# Conway's Game of Life in Verilog
This project is a Verilog implementation of Conway's Game of Life, with the purpose of implementing on an FPGA.

The repository has two mains parts, respectively contained in the following folders:

- ***src/*** The source code for an efficient implementation of Conway's Game of Life. You can see this code simulated online at EDA Playground!
- ***FSM Encodings/*** A comparison of the outcome of using 3 different encodings for Finite State Machines. This comparison is featured in one of my articles on [allaboutcircuits.com](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/author/eduardo-corpeno/). 3 encodings were used for 3 different FSMs on 3 different platforms, adding up to 27 projects: 9 in Lattice's Diamond, 9 in Intel's Quartus Prime, and 9 in Xilinx's Vivado Design Suite.
